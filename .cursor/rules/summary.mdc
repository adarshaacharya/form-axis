# Form Pilot Form Summary

## Project Overview
AI-native Forms that are purely conversational. You set up the form or survey by just writing down a bunch of prompts. It gives you a link you can share for people to “fill out the form”. But it’s just a chat UI. Who wants to press “other” and fill in a little textbox when you could just answer?

## Key Features
- ask user for prompt on which topic they link to create form on
- generate questions based on prompt by user using gemini llm
- create shareable link of that form
- user will submit answer one by one 
- at the end show answers summary
- list down all the forms generated by user in table and show responses as well

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI components
- **Backend**:  Next.js with server actions
- **Database**: Convex
- **AI**: Gemini
- **Deployment**: Vercel 
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Architecture
The project follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**:
   - Organized using the App Router pattern
   - Uses server components and server actions


3. **Database (Convex)**:
   - Stores forms of user alongside the questions of form, responses of user
   - Uses convex as database 

4. **AI Integration**:
   - Uses LLMs to generate the questions based on the user prompt given eg. if user asks to generate the form for event review ai should list down all questions based on that
